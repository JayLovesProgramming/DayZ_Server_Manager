# DayZ_Server_Manager

## WINDOWS ONLY UNLESS YOU EDIT THE CODE SO IT CAN RUN IN A DOCKER CONTAINER INSTEAD OF RUNNING VIA .BAT FILE

All of these scripts are needed for full functionality!

I recommend placing all these script in their own folder named "Utils"
For example: C:\DayZServer\resources\Utils
Doing this will make the setup process of this python script MUCH easier

A 100% SUCCESS RATE SET-UP GUIDE

# Step 1:

Place all of these scripts inside of resources/Utils APART from the start.bat
**The start.bat needs be in the main directory**
(eg.C:\DayZServer\resources)

# Step 2:

Setup config.json for your servers liking (eg. server ip, server name, discord webhook etc)

# Step 3:

Run the start.bat

When you run the start.bat it should open the python script which then opens this window. The rest is pretty self explantory.
If you want the server to automatically start when you hit start.bat then you have that option to enable or disable

With the update, you now have a option for it to open two other command prompt windows

One is for the discord killfeed script and one is for the logging steam ids script which is used in the discord killfeed script
